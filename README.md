# Path Visualization using A* Algorithm
- Build a path finding visualizertool to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm as it runs
- The astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient than the standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search
## Procedure to Run the Program
- Use **python astar.py**
- Select starting and ending positions in the grid between which you want to find the distance
- Create barriers according to your choice and then press space
- Press **c** to clear the grid and rerun
