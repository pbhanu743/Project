# Path Visualization using A* Algorithm
- Build a path finding visualizertool to visualize the A* pathfinding algorithm as it runs
- The astar pathfinding algorithm is an informed search algorithm which means it is much more efficient than the standard algorithms like breadth first search or depth first search
